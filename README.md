# Feed the doggie

In this project we built a game with Phaser 3. Your player is an adorable corgi, and the goal is to eat fruits, vegetables and chicken but be on the lokout and avoid the dreaded vacuum! Kudos to you if you can to play the whole game with music on :grimacing:

# Installation

- after cloning or downloading the repo, cd into the folder containing it
- open up your terminal and:
  - `npm install` to get all the plugins
  - `npm start` to start the game
